The version is Python3.7

To use the code, please see as follow.
1. put pa3_test.csv , pa3_train.csv , pa3_val.csv , Adaboost.py , decision_tree.py , assfile.py into the same file.

2. then if you want to test the first part, use command "python decision_tree.py" to run the code. (use command "python randomforest.py" to run the second part)(use command "python Adaboost.py" to run the third part)


3. If you want to change the n, m depth, then "vim dicision_tree.py" to change the depth, "vim randomforest.py" to change the n, m, and depth, and so as in the Adaboost.py.
